# pushswap
A C sorting algorithm that sorts a stack using another stack and a specific set of instrructions:  
  SA/SB/SS swaps first and second elements of stack (stack A or stack B or both).  
  PA/PB takes first element of the stack and puts it at the top of the other (stack A or stack B).  
  RA/RB/RR shift up all elements of the stack, first become last (stack A or stack B or both).  
  RRA/RRB/RRR shift down all elements of the stack, last become first (stack A, stack B or both)
